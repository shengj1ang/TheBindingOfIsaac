	20240606: 
		The path of the save was finally discovered by me. So I saved.
		But no further saves from this date from me.
		Saved by Flash Player on MacOS, WindowsSize is set to 'LARGE'. 
		If Ruffle usees this save, the display is zoomed in too much.
		Deaths: 418, Mom Kills: 57, Items: 174. Secrets Found: 53/89
	20240607:
		Deaths: 420, Mom Kills: 57, Items: 174. Secrets Found: 53/89
		Same as 20240606 except the WindowsSize is set to 'MED' and more Deaths because of the test.
